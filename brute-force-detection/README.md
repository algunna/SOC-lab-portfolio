# Brute Force Detection

## Scenario
Multiple failed authentication attempts were detected against a user account. This lab simulates a brute-force attack scenario commonly handled by a SOC analyst.

## Investigation Steps
- Reviewed authentication logs and SIEM alerts
- Identified repeated failed login attempts from a single source
- Correlated timestamps and user activity
- Determined whether activity met escalation criteria

## Outcome
Confirmed brute-force behavior and documented findings, indicators, and recommended response actions.
