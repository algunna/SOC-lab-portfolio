This repository contains hands on security labs that reflect how I approach SOC analysis, alert triage, and incident investigation using real logs and realistic workflows.

## About Me
I work in security operations with a focus on alert review, log analysis, and incident investigation. I analyze authentication, endpoint, and cloud activity to understand what happened, assess risk, and determine the correct response. I build clear timelines, identify abnormal behavior, and document findings in a way that supports escalation and decision making. This portfolio shows how I approach real security events using raw data, context, and disciplined analysis rather than relying on tools alone.

### SOC Labs & Projects

- **Brute Force Detection**  
  Simulated authentication attacks and analyzed SIEM alerts to identify brute-force activity, document findings, and define escalation criteria.

- **Malware Analysis**  
  Reviewed suspicious file behavior and endpoint logs to determine indicators of compromise and response actions.

- **Phishing Investigation**  
  Analyzed email artifacts, headers, and links to identify phishing indicators and document incident timelines.

- **Ransomware Incident Response**  
  Simulated ransomware activity, reviewed alerts, and documented containment and response steps.

- **Network Segmentation Review**  
  Evaluated network segmentation controls and identified potential lateral movement paths.
